# Evermore Collective Self‑Sovereign Document Integrity System

This repository provides a flat‑file infrastructure designed to protect and preserve the Evermore Collective’s records without reliance on any single platform. By using plain text files and cryptographic proofs, the collective can independently manage documents, seal them, and anchor their integrity on the blockchain.

## Folder Structure

- **artifacts/sealed/** – Holds sealed, immutable documents.
- **artifacts/drafts/** – Contains working drafts awaiting review and sealing.
- **artifacts/appendices/** – Stores appendices and supplementary materials.
- **ledger/** – Change logs, seal logs, and registries that track document history and integrity.
- **proofs/ots/** – OpenTimestamps files for anchoring documents on a public blockchain.
- **proofs/checksums/** – Checksum files for verifying file integrity.
- **scripts/** – Automation scripts for hashing, sealing, anchoring, and other tasks.
- **config/** – Configuration files, such as the collective manifest.
- **site/css/** and **site/js/** – Assets for the collective’s static website.

## Rails

The Evermore system is guided by six rails—principles that ground our governance and integrity. Placeholders are listed below and should be updated to reflect the collective’s definitive rails:
